# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Fix: stale heartbeat/meter-value loops kept running after a reconnect, spamming
  `ConnectionClosedOK` warnings. All per-connection tasks are now cancelled when the
  connection drops, and a clean server close (1000) triggers a reconnect.
- Workaround: accept RemoteStopTransaction when the server's transactionId doesn't
  match the active transaction (seen with Octopus sending `1` instead of the issued id).
